# 🥗 Veggie Options Analysis

> Okay, let’s talk about the veggie options. Based on reviews, there’s a mixed experience.

### The Biggest Concern

* Several customers noted a lack of freshness and flavor in standard vegetable toppings.

  * Example: canned mushrooms, soft/faded peppers, sparse onions.

### Bright Spot for Vegans

* Vegan pizzas receive overwhelmingly positive feedback:

  * Homemade cashew cheese that melts well
  * Fresh, seasonal vegetable toppings

### Other Notes

* White pizza with spinach and ricotta is very popular and well-balanced
* Gluten-free cauliflower crust option available
* Some vegan cheese substitutes may have issues (meltability, coconut flavor)

**Summary:**
Vegetarians and vegans likely have a **better experience** here than those seeking traditional veggie toppings.

**Follow-up Question:**
Do you want details on specific toppings, crusts, or vegan cheese alternatives?

If you want, I can also **make it look like a “fancy terminal” style MD** with **blockquotes, code styling for user input, and emoji icons for categories**—very clean for documentation or GitHub README.

Do you want me to do that version?
